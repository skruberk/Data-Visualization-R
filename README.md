This repository is a collection of biological data visualization workflows using R and often the tidyverse. It runs from importing data (from MATLAB, FIJI, or excel) to visualizing data using various plots including
following the instructions for Superplots (Lord et al. JCB "SuperPlots: Communicating reproducibility and variability in cell biology, 2020). Also includes a few shell scripts for data directory management.
